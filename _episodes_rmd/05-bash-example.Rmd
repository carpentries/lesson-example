This episode demonstrates all the features that can be used
when using Bash from [RMarkdown][r-markdown].

You can include chunk for codes, just like you'd normally do.

Normal output:

```{bash}
pwd
```

Output with error message:

```{bash}
foo
```

For the challenges and their solutions, you need to pay attention to where the
`>` go and where to leave blank lines. You can include code chunks in both the
instructions and solutions. For instance

```
> ## Challenge: Can you do it?
>
> What is the output of this command?
>
> ```{bash, eval=FALSE}`r ''`
> ls data -a -F
> ```
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```{bash, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
> > ls data -a -F
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
```

will generate
