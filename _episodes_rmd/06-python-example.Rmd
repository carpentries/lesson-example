```

This episode demonstrates all the features that can be used
when using Python from [RMarkdown][r-markdown].

You can include chunk for codes, just like you'd normally do.

Normal output:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

Output with error message:

```{python}
x[10]
```

Output generating figures:

```{python python-plot-example}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.show()
```

For the challenges and their solutions, you need to pay attention to where the
`>` go and where to leave blank lines. You can include code chunks in both the
instructions and solutions. For instance

```
> ## Challenge: Can you do it?
>
> What is the output of this command?
>
> ```{python, eval=FALSE}`r ''`
> print("This new template looks good!")
> ```
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```{python, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
> > print("This new template looks good!")
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
```

will generate

> ## Challenge: Can you do it?

> > ## Solution

> {: .solution}
