This episode demonstrates all the features that can be used when writing a
lesson in RMarkdown.

This first chunk is really important, and should be included in all markdown lessons.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
```

The rest of the lesson should be written as a normal RMarkdown file. You can
include chunk for codes, just like you'd normally do:

Normal output:

```{r}
1 + 1
```


Output with error message:

```{r}
x[10]
```

Output generating figures:

```{r plot-example}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat,  y = price, color = cut)) +
    geom_point()
```

For the challenges and their solutions, you need to pay attention to the where
the `>` go and where to leave blank lines. Otherwise, you can include chunks in
it to include instructions and solutions.
