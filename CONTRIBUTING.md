Software Carpentry is an open source project,
and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
new lessons,
fixes to existing material,
bug reports,

## Getting Started

1.  Please see [the README](README.html#getting-and-giving-help)
    for advice on getting and giving help.

2.  We use GitHub flow to manage changes,
    which is explained in the chapter [Contributing to a Project][pro-git-chapter]
    in Scott Chacon's book *Pro Git*.

3.  For our lessons,
    you should branch from and submit pull requests against the `gh-pages` branch.

4.  When editing lesson pages, you need only commit changes to the Markdown source files.

5.  If you're looking for things to work on,
    please see [the list of issues for this repository][issues]
    or for [the template][lesson-template-issues],
    or have a look at [our actual lessons][swc-lessons].
    Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are equally welcome.

6.  If you want to submit a change that *doesn't* address an open
    issue with this repository, please review our list of [frequently
    argued issues][fai] (FAI) to avoid rehashing past discussions.  If
    your change is not covered by an FAI entry, go ahead and submit
    it.  If your change is covered by an FAI entry but the the reasons
    for resolving the FAI seem incomplete, please submit a pull
    request explaining why and adjusting the FAI entry.
