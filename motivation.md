## Our Mission

We make scientists and engineering more productive by teaching them basic computing skills.


## The Problem

- Surveyed 1972 scientists in 2008.
- "How do you use computers?"
- "How did you learn what you know?"


## The Problem

- Scientists spend 40% of their time building or using software.
- 55% say this figure is rising.
- *96% are mostly self-taught*.


## The Problem

- No hard data on how *well* they do things.
- But anecdotal evidence suggests "not very".


## Our Solution

- Intensive hands-on training.
- Two full days of instruction.
- Unix shell (automate repetitive tasks)
- Git and GitHub (track and share work)
- Python or R (build modular code)
- SQL (manage data)


## Outcomes

- 20% improvement in productivity is common.
- 10X isn't rare.


## Outcomes

- Empowers people.
- HPC, the cloud, web services, big data, ...
- Reproducible research, open science, ...


## The Details

- Materials are all open access.
- Instructors are volunteers.
- Only cost is travel and accommodation
- (but contributions to central costs are welcome).


## How To Help

- Come and learn.
- Join the discussion.
- Host a workshop.
- Become an instructor.
- Create new teaching materials.
